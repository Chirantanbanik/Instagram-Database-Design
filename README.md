# Instagram_Database_Design

Tech Stack used - MySQL

We will first create a database with name **Instagram_database_design**
after that letâ€™s find out what the features or the table we can design.

## **Users**

This is our first feature of the table, in this we can put many attributes but we will take only a few like ID, Username, email, location. 
We will be taking the ID as a primary key because ID is unique for every user, for username we will be taking Unique value because username should be unique for every user, for email we can take the same email ID and for location too we can take the same location.
